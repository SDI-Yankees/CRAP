Consolidated Reporting of Airman and Personnel

## Overview
Team Members - Roles:

- Sam - Doc Queen
- Jeremy - Time Knight
- Eric - Git King
- Derek - User Story Clerk

### Problem Statement: 

As an airmen/service member, I don't have a central place to track and view training requirements/statuses for myself and my personnel. This then requires me to aggregate training data from multiple locations to create reports so that leadership can make more informed decisions.

### How app addresses the problem: 

### User CRUD: Login, view training, add training, update status, and delete

## MVP

- Login
- View: All, overdue, coming due (30 days)

## Target Persona:

- Supervision
- Airmen
- Training Managers
